# ADMIN-AI RUNBOOK

## Relationship to LeadGen (Future)
LeadGen handles public intake ingestion. Employee UI (next phase) performs review actions, and later Admin-AI control plane
may govern conversion of leads into client identities (Keycloak/LDAP), audit enforcement, and policy controls.
No Admin-AI dependency exists for LeadGen ingestion in v1.
